My reasons for not believing in in God have never been as clear to me, that's why I think it is a good opportunity to document them.

> When faced with competing hypotheses, select the one that makes the fewest assumptions.

## [Hitchens's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27s_razor)

> The burden of proof or onus in a debate lies with the claim-maker, and if he or she does not meet it, the opponent does not need to argue against the unfounded claim.

> If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation then it is not worthy of debate.

## Bonus: [Pascal's Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager)

Pascal's Wager states that believing in God only incurs a relatively small investment. Since we can't rule out that God does _not_ exist one would be better off to believe in God. If he does exist we can refer to our belief, if he doesn't the lost investment wasn't too big of a deal.

Because I don't see any evidence for an afterlife, our lives in the present is all we have. Therefore I like to spend it in the best possible way.
