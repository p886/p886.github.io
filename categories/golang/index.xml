&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2015 I wanted to relief my neighbors of the burden of enduring the noises of me playing guitar and singing. I therefore took my guitar and went to a nearby park. Starting to play and sing in public triggered a substantial amount of self-consciousness. I persevered nevertheless. These are the realizations and effects of playing maybe 20 times in a public space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, you should accept that you will feel self-conscious but try not to act on this emotion. 95% of the people who saw / heard me didn&amp;rsquo;t care or at least pretended to not care. All of the reactions I did get where positive.&lt;/p&gt;
